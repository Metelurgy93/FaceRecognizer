Machine Learning Assignment No. 1

System Configuration:
1. OS version used: Macintosh 10.13.3
2. Computer Architecture
	Manufacturer: 		Apple
	Model:			Macbook Pro(15-inch, Mid 2012)
	Processor: 		Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU @ 2.3GHz Quad Core
	Installed Memory:	8.0 GB Ram size.
	System Type:		64-bit Operating System, x64-based processor
	Hard drive:		256GB SSD + 1TB HDD
		
3. 	Language used: Python 2.7
	Scripting tool: Spyder 

4. Step-by-step compilation and execution of instructions

	Loading the image data sets into the memory.

Implemented the Naive Bayes Classifier.

Implemented the batch gradient descent based regularized logistic regression function.

Implemented stochastic gradient decent based regularized logistic regression.

The performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Measures are recored for the above there experiments.

The ROC Plots are drawn for the above three experiments.

A single ROC plot contains the 3 ROC curves for the naive bayes, gradient descent based regularized logistic regression, stochastic gradient decent based regularized logistic regression

All the experiments are performed  and the time taken to train was approximately around 15 minutes for all the experiments.

Using , I ran a build of the codes and debug for errors. 
No errors where found. This allowed a view of the sample output.
All the codes and information where placed in a zip and submitted for assessment.
